# Banking Data Analysis Pipeline
Data pipeline for banking transactions analysis.

## Overview
This project implements a data pipeline for banking transaction analysis. The pipeline consists of multiple steps: data ingestion, data cleaning, quality checks, and analysis.

## Steps
1. **Data Ingestion**: The `01_ingest_raw_data.ipynb` script loads the raw banking transaction data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The `02_data_cleaning_transformation.ipynb` script cleans the data, handling missing values.
3. **Analysis and Reporting**: The `03_analysis_queries.ipynb` script performs basic analysis, including total deposits by customer, pivot table showing amount of deposit and withdrawal for each date and customer, etc.
